This is my project on finding a split metric decomposition for distance matrices.  
  
Simulations:  
  
* Results for the [distance-based regression method (without standardization) on a four population dataset](distance-based-regression-simulation.html)
* Results for the [distance-based regression method with standardization on an eight population dataset](8-population-example.html). 


These are old analysis files for a data-based regression method:  

* Results for the [data-based regression method on a four population dataset](four-population-simulation.html)
* Results [comparing the data-based regression method with EBCD and GBCD on a six population dataset](regression-simulation.html)
